# Snake

This project represents a clone of the classic Snake video game, written in C++.

## Gameplay

The player controls a snake, guiding it across the board in order to reach and eat objects. Every eaten object makes the snake longer, thus increasing the game difficulty.

The player loses when the snake hits a wall or a part of its body.
